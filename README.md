A collection of helper methods for [go.net/html](https://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/go.net/html). The document is available at [godoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/thinxer/go-htmlutil).

This work was mainly done while I was employed by [Hohoyi.com](http://hohoyi.com) and was part of the [Sight](https://sight.sc) app.
